# Eight-Puzzle
This Eight-Puzzle project implements three search algorithms. Uniform Cost Search (aka Breadth First Search), Misplaced Tile Heuristic Search, and Manhattan Distance Heuristic Search. This program allows the user to type in any eight puzzle configuration and which algorithm they want to use. The solution will then display and give the results at the bottom. The results compose of three things: number of nodes expanded, maximum queue size allocated, and solution depth.
